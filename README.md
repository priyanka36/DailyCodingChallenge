# DAILY CODING PRACTICE (QUESTIONS FROM GOOGLE,FACEBOOK,AMAZON)

Assert in Python
In Python, the assert statement is used to continue the execute if the given condition evaluates to True. If the assert condition evaluates to False, then it raises the AssertionError exception with the specified error message.

## DAY-1
-Given a list of numbers, return whether any two sums to k. For example, given [10, 15, 3, 7] and k of 17, return true since 10 + 7 is 17.
Bonus: Can you do this in one pass?

## DAY-2
-Given an array of integers, return a new array such that each element at index i of the new array is the product of all the numbers in the original array except the one at i.

For example, if our input was [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], the expected output would be [120, 60, 40, 30, 24]. If our input was [3, 2, 1], the expected output would be [2, 3, 6].

Follow-up: what if you can't use division?
